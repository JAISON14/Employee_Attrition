# Employee_Attrition
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelprashant/employee-attrition 

## About this project
-> Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an employee attrition dataset and identified significant features impacting attrition, such as OverTime, JobRole, and BusinessTravel.
-> Performed data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
-> Applied feature selection techniques, including univariate statistical tests, feature importance scores, and recursive feature elimination, to select the most relevant features.
-> Trained and evaluated multiple binary classification algorithms, utilizing stratified K-Fold cross-validation to account for class imbalance in the dataset.
-> Selected the F1-score as the primary evaluation metric to balance precision and recall.
-> Conducted hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearch to optimize the performance of top-performing models, with Logistic Regression achieving an F1-score of 0.481 on the test set.
-> Explored techniques to handle imbalanced datasets, such as oversampling with SMOTE and ensemble methods like RUSBoost and EasyEnsemble.
-> Analyzed feature importance scores and partial dependence plots to interpret the models' decision-making processes, identifying OverTime, JobRole, and BusinessTravel as key features.
-> Developed predictive models to identify employees at risk of leaving the company, enabling timely interventions and retention strategies to improve employee satisfaction and reduce attrition rates.
